            <h1>How To Start As a Believer</h1>
            <h4 class="page-three-intro">There are many people curious about Jesus, and about Christianity. There are also those who want to know what religion they should be a part of, or what church they want to be in, or most closely tie there beleifs to. 
                If you are one of those people, then you have come to the right place.

                <p>As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I believe that all religions have truth. My primary purpose in writing this section of my website is to bring those who trust and glory in truth to find more of it. 
                I myself am someone who takes truth and runs with it wherever I find it. The key then, is determining what is true and what is not true on our own. But do we truly have to do it on our own? There is something called the Holy Ghost, which is the bearer of all truth. 
                If you don't believe that, or if you don't know what I mean, why not test it out? If you haven't ever prayed, or if it's been a while since you have prayed to God, it might be a good place to start. Prayer is like a conduit to heaven, and when we reach out to heaven, heaven always reaches to us. 
                Therefore, when we pray, we have the opportunity to feel of this Holy Ghost, who has no body, but is completely a Spirit, which allows it to be in the hearts of many all at once. I don't claim to fully understand how that works, but I believe it because it is something the Holy Ghost has taught me.

                You see, the Holy Ghost can be found when experimented upon, even if it seems difficult or strange. And we don't need to be scared of it - it is entirely a good feeling. It's sort of like the wind, because we don't see it, but we hear it and feel it, and this is enough to know that it is there. 
                We simply have to reach to heaven with an honest heart and a good intention if we want to feel and hear it. For those who seek to believe, first seek the Holy Ghost, and then seek the scriptures. The word of God is a beautiful way to come to an understanding of what Jesus is all about. 
                The Bible is a wonderful resource, and so is the Book of Mormon, which is another witness of Jesus Christ. Now, scriptures may say things that sound harsh or insensitive. But please realize, it is all coming from a place of love. And once you are commited to reading and understanding them with a faithful and honest heart, it is possible to know this truth for yourself as well. 
                Truth is not something that is individual for ourselves. That would be called an opinion. Rather, truth is something that is universal, and allows for us to understand the world and even the eternities much better.

            If you are curious at all about where we were before this life, and where we will go after, I would invite you to pray to heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, who is our Savior and Redeemer, to know if what I am saying is true, and then to search for greater truths. 
            If you can accept the things I offer here, there will be much more that you will be able to recieve. Or in other words, you will be more ready to receive the actual words of prophets and servants of Jesus Christ. Finally I will mention something that I believe to be true. 
            If you have made it this far then I commend you. What I want to say to all those who do not know Jesus Christ is that I truly believe that He not only existed, but that He was resurrected and lives, and will come to earth again, which we will need to prepare for. 
            By following the guidance of His servants the prophets, we can find Him, and get to know Him through becoming like Him. This is the process we must follow, for our own sake, that we might live with God again in the heavens, and receive joy and rest with Him and with His Son Jesus Christ. 
            All of these things I say in His name, because I love and know Him, and I have committed to follow Him to the bitter end, no matter what happens.
