        An Achiever Believer is someone who doesn't give up. Someone who not only believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, but is committed to serve Him.
        A little about myself, I am a college student currently attending Brigham Young University - Idaho. I have plans to become a software engineer by the end of my schooling. I also plan to support a future family both spiritually and temporally. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I play the violin and enjoy basketball as well.
        Why come to this site as opposed to somewhere where there could be more credible information, you ask? This site has many purposes, but one that stands out is that it is here to provide a secondary source. There is plenty of anti literature and anti Christian websites to go around. But are there secondary sources for the pro Christians out there? There may very well be, and I do not claim to be the first, however I feel it doesn't hurt to add on. 
        In other words, this site is here to provide some counter measures against those resources that are against the Church of Jesus Christ, and against Jesus Himself. By doing so, and by people being able to see more information out on the web that isn't from a primary source, such as ChurchofJesusChrist.org, there will be more reason for people to believe rather than to disbelieve, and more reason to go to that primary source which has much more useful information.
        Another way of putting it is that this site is to lead others to Jesus Christ, His church, and the website hosted by the members of His church.
        My goal is to help those who see this to first become a believer as I have been mentioning, but it is also to provide my own personal testimony on how to become an achiever believer, which is the ultimate goal of this site. Firstly, it is to help others to come to Christ and receive secondary resources to provide information that is pro Christianity, and secondly, it is to practice building my own testimony by sharing it with others online. 
        I do not expect my testimony to change many hearts, or to make a super meaningful impact on many people, however, making this site will help my own testimony in Jesus to grow, which in turn will help me to share a more powerful testimony to others later in life.

      <h3>How to Become an Achiever Believer</h3>
      <p>
        The word: "Achiever" is an acronym. It stands for: Accepting, Centered in Christ, Harmonious (with gospel teachings), Example (of the believers), Inspired (by study and by faith), Virtuous, an Excellent covenant keeper, and Repentant. I will go through each of these one at a time.
        Accepting: to become an achiever believer, you have to first be accepting of Jesus Christ. This means aligning our will with His, no matter what. This takes great faith, and is essentially an increase of that faith. To be able to accept all the pain and sorrows that will come our way in life, and accpet that God allowed it to happen to us, or to be patient in waiting for His blessings, is very difficult, but this is accepting Jesus Christ.
        Centered on Christ: This has a lot to do with our covenants made at baptism. When we make those covenants, we commit to stand as a witness of Jesus Christ at all times, and this means that we need to always be thinking of Him. By doing so, we can have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us at all times. We need to be thinking of Jesus Christ often because He is the One who redeemed us and bought us back from the adversary. He is the One who we can fully rely and trust in, therefore we must always put our thoughts towards Him, for our sake.
        Harmonious: To be harmonious with the teachings of the gospel means not only to obey the most basic of teachings, but to be willing to become sanctified and be willing to obey every commandment to the fullest. To be harmonious to the gospel of Jesus Christ, we don't need to be perfect, but we do need to be striving to be obedient and one day sanctified through our efforts and desire to do so.
        Inspired by study and by faith: What this means is that we need to receive personal revelation. President Nelson has said that we will soon not be able to survive spiritually if we are not receving personal revelation. I believe this is also the case with the scriptures. If we are not reading the scriptures, and not striving to hear God's voice, we will surely fall from the attacks and whirlwinds of the devil. Therefore, we need to be inspired both by the prophets, old and new, and also by the Holy Ghost.
        Example of the believers: To be an example of the believers is something that Paul teaches in the New Testament. It is to love one another, and to love God. Jesus Himself said that "by this shall men know ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." By doing so we can help others come to Christ, which is an essential part of becoming His disciple.
        Virtuous: There are many virtues, such as chastity, patience and compassion. All virtues of the gospel of Jesus Christ are imprortant to have, and will help us along the path to covenant discipleship immensely.
        Excellent Covenant Keeper: To be an excellent covenant keeper is to first participate in the ordinances of the priesthood, namely baptism, and the ordinances provided in the Lord's house, the temple. By participating in thes ordinances, we can receive and move into sacred covenants that help us to commit to make the right choices, and literally and spiritually bind us to God. These covenants are not mere promises, but they are binding between us and God, and if we keep them, the promised blessings are so great that no man can fully comprehend them.
        Repentant: To be repentant, or penitent, is to have godly sorrow for sins. We all make mistakes, and we all fall short of the obedience that is required of us. Nevertheless, Jesus died and suffered in the garden of Gethsemane for us so that we might be able to repent. He satisfied the demands of jsutice, that we might have mercy.
        All of this is my testimony of how we can truly become more than just a believer, but become an Achiever Believer.

      <h3>How to Start as a Believer</h3>
      <p>
        There are many people curious about Jesus, and about Christianity. There are also those who want to know what religion they should be a part of, or what church they want to be in, or most closely tie there beleifs to. If you are one of those people, then you have come to the right place.
        As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I believe that all religions have truth. My primary purpose in writing this section of my website is to bring those who trust and glory in truth to find more of it. I myself am someone who takes truth and runs with it wherever I find it. The key then, is determining what is true and what is not true on our own.
        But do we truly have to do it on our own? There is something called the Holy Ghost, which is the bearer of all truth. If you don't believe that, or if you don't know what I mean, why not test it out? If you haven't ever prayed, or if it's been a while since you have prayed to God, it might be a good place to start. Prayer is like a conduit to heaven, and when we reach out to heaven, heaven always reaches to us.
        Therefore, when we pray, we have the opportunity to feel of this Holy Ghost, who has no body, but is completely a Spirit, which allows it to be in the hearts of many all at once. I don't claim to fully understand how that works, but I believe it because it is something the Holy Ghost has taught me.
        You see, the Holy Ghost can be found when experimented upon, even if it seems difficult or strange. And we don't need to be scared of it - it is entirely a good feeling. It's sort of like the wind, because we don't see it, but we hear it and feel it, and this is enough to know that it is there. We simply have to reach to heaven with an honest heart and a good intention if we want to feel and hear it. 
        For those who seek to believe, first seek the Holy Ghost, and then seek the scriptures. The word of God is a beautiful way to come to an understanding of what Jesus is all about. The Bible is a wonderful resource, and so is the Book of Mormon, which is another witness of Jesus Christ. Now, scriptures may say things that sound harsh or insensitive. But please realize, it is all coming from a place of love. And once you are commited to reading and understanding them with a faithful and honest heart, it is possible to know this truth for yourself as well.
        Truth is not something that is individual for ourselves. That would be called an opinion. Rather, truth is something that is universal, and allows for us to understand the world and even the eternities much better. If you are curious at all about where we were before this life, and where we will go after, I would invite you to pray to heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, who is our Savior and Redeemer, to know if what I am saying is true, and then to search for greater truths. If you can accept the things I offer here, there will be much more that you will be able to recieve. Or in other words, you will be more ready to receive the actual words of prophets and servants of Jesus Christ.
        Finally I will mention something that I believe to be true. If you have made it this far then I commend you. What I want to say to all those who do not know Jesus Christ is that I truly believe that He not only existed, but that He was resurrected and lives, and will come to earth again, which we will need to prepare for. By following the guidance of His servants the prophets, we can find Him, and get to know Him through becoming like Him. This is the process we must follow, for our own sake, that we might live with God again in the heavens, and receive joy and rest with Him and with His Son Jesus Christ. All of these things I say in His name, because I love and know Him, and I have committed to follow Him to the bitter end, no matter what happens.
