            <h2>More Than Just A Believer!</h2>
            <h4 class="home-page-intro">An Achiever Believer is someone who doesn't give up. Someone who not only believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, but is committed to serve Him.</h4>
        <div class="home-page-part-one">
            <p class="site-purpose">Why come to this site as opposed to somewhere where there could be more credible information, you ask? This site has many purposes, but one that stands out is that it is here to provide a secondary source. 
            There is plenty of anti literature and anti Christian websites to go around. But are there secondary sources for the pro Christians out there? There may very well be, and I do not claim to be the first, however I feel it doesn't hurt to add on. 
            In other words, this site is here to provide some counter measures against those resources that are against the Church of Jesus Christ, and against Jesus Himself. 
            By doing so, and by people being able to see more information out on the web that isn't from a primary source, such as ChurchofJesusChrist.org, there will be more reason for people to believe rather than to disbelieve, and more reason to go to that primary source which has much more useful information. 
            Another way of putting it is that this site is to lead others to Jesus Christ, His church, and the website hosted by the members of His church. 
            My goal is to help those who see this to first become a believer as I have been mentioning, but it is also to provide my own personal testimony on how to become an achiever believer, which is the ultimate goal of this site. 
            Firstly, it is to help others to come to Christ and receive secondary resources to provide information that is pro Christianity, and secondly, it is to practice building my own testimony by sharing it with others online. 
            I do not expect my testimony to change many hearts, or to make a super meaningful impact on many people, however, making this site will help my own testimony in Jesus to grow, which in turn will help me to share a more powerful testimony to others later in life.

            <p class="testimony"> [I will probably add more to this later on] My testimony is that God hears us, knows us, and most of all loves us. That love is greater than any force imaginable. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) 
                Jesus is the light of the world, and I invite anyone who desires to go to Him, and to love Him, but just aren't sure how, to be patient and keep reading. The best is yet to come!
