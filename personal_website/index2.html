            <h1>How To Become An Achiever Believer</h1>
            <h4 class="page-two-intro">The word: "Achiever" is an acronym. It stands for: Accepting, Centered in Christ, Harmonious (with gospel teachings), Example (of the believers), Inspired (by study and by faith), Virtuous, an Excellent covenant keeper, and Repentant.
            The purpose of this page is to go through each of these one at a time, explaining what they mean and how to approach using them from day to day life. It will be geared more towards those who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</h4>

            <section class="acronym-explanation">
                <p>Accepting: To become an achiever believer, you have to first be accepting of Jesus Christ. This means aligning our will with His, no matter what. This takes great faith, and is essentially an increase of that faith. 
                To be able to accept all the pain and sorrows that will come our way in life, and accpet that God allowed it to happen to us, or to be patient in waiting for His blessings, is very difficult, but this is accepting Jesus Christ.
                </p>
                <p>Centered on Christ: This has a lot to do with our covenants made at baptism. When we make those covenants, we commit to stand as a witness of Jesus Christ at all times, and this means that we need to always be thinking of Him. 
                By doing so, we can have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us at all times. We need to be thinking of Jesus Christ often because He is the One who redeemed us and bought us back from the adversary. He is the One who we can fully rely and trust in, therefore we must always put our thoughts towards Him, for our sake. 
                </p>
                <p>Harmonious: To be harmonious with the teachings of the gospel means not only to obey the most basic of teachings, but to be willing to become sanctified and be willing to obey every commandment to the fullest. 
                To be harmonious to the gospel of Jesus Christ, we don't need to be perfect, but we do need to be striving to be obedient and one day sanctified through our efforts and desire to do so.
                </p>
                <p>Inspired by study and by faith: What this means is that we need to receive personal revelation. 
                The Prophet of our day, President Russell M. Nelson, has said that we will soon not be able to survive spiritually if we are not receving personal revelation. I believe this is also the case with the scriptures. If we are not reading the scriptures, and not striving to hear God's voice, we will surely fall from the attacks and whirlwinds of the devil. 
                Therefore, we need to be inspired both by the prophets, old and new, and also by the Holy Ghost.
                </p>     
                <p>Example of the believers: To be an example of the believers is something that Paul teaches in the New Testament. It is to love one another, and to love God. 
                Jesus Himself said that "by this shall men know ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." By doing so we can help others come to Christ, which is an essential part of becoming His disciple.
                </p> 
                <p>Virtuous: There are many virtues, such as chastity, patience and compassion. 
                All virtues of the gospel of Jesus Christ are imprortant to have, and will help us along the path to covenant discipleship immensely.
                </p> 
                <p>Excellent Covenant Keeper: To be an excellent covenant keeper is to first participate in the ordinances of the priesthood, namely baptism, and the ordinances provided in the Lord's house, the temple. 
                By participating in thes ordinances, we can receive and move into sacred covenants that help us to commit to make the right choices, and literally and spiritually bind us to God. These covenants are not mere promises, but they are binding between us and God, and if we keep them, the promised blessings are so great that no man can fully comprehend them.
                </p>
                <p>Repentant: To be repentant, or penitent, is to have godly sorrow for sins. We all make mistakes, and we all fall short of the obedience that is required of us. Nevertheless, Jesus died and suffered in the garden of Gethsemane for us so that we might be able to repent. He satisfied the demands of jsutice, that we might have mercy. 
                All of this is my testimony of how we can truly become more than just a believer, but become an Achiever Believer.

            <p class="clarification">If you're uncertain of what most of this means, consider going to page three. There you will find additional information on what it means to follow the Savior. Most of all though, go to the scriptures and the words of God's servants. There you will find more truth than I could ever give. Couple this study with prayer, and you'll be well on your way to discipleship in no time!</p>
