    <h2>W. Peter Ashworth</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I like to play and watch basketball, and my favorite team is the Warriors. I also play the violin, and occasionally some good video games. </p>
    <p>My favorite scripure is in the Book of Mormon: Helaman 3:27-30. Part of it says that "whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful..." I love this scripture because the word of God has gotten me through some pretty tough times in life, and I'm super grateful for God's mercy in helping me realize it's ability to truly help me. </p>
